a SPM5 toolbox to create SPM5 toolboxes

Many comments are written in chinese, on windows, GB2312.

The [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences. see offical website[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/](). The lattest verison is SPM8, I don't know whether this toolbox works ok on the secceeding versions.
